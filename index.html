<FONT COLOR="pink" SIZE=5>Origami is derived from two Japanese words:
 Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that,
 the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). 
Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with
 Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word "origami" is
 used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.

<ul><li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.</li><li> 
They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.
</li><li> They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs,
  and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li><li>
Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. </li><li>
They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’.</li><li>
 A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will 
 travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li><li>
Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li></ul></FONT> </p>

on a hunting trip in 1902.

The first toy stuffed bear was created by German toymaker Margarete Steiff. She created a soft
 plush with movable arms and legs and a friendly face after taking her nephew to the zoo in 1903.

The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.
